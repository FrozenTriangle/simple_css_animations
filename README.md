# CSS SLIDESHOW TESTING
Testing CSS animations with a simple slideshow

## Challenge :
No JavaScript because JavaScript is evil (not really).

## Was it really a challenge?
Not really. Animations and keyframes are fairly understandable.

## Next step :
I don't know, find a hobby I guess.

## No, honestly what is this repo?
This repo is a basic CSS only infinite slider. CSS3 provides a bunch of cool animations I wanted to show someone. Because I wanted this person to watch the "Pop Team Epic" anime, I used screenshots from the said anime to remind them to watch it.
