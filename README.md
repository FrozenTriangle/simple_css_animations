# CSS SLIDESHOW TESTING
Testing CSS animations

## Challenge :
No JavaScript because JavaScript is evil (not really).

## Was it really a challenge?
Not really. Animations and keyframes are fairly understandable.

## Next step :
I don't know, find a hobby I guess.

## No, honestly what is this repo?
This repo will allow me to try a few stuff with CSS animations.
